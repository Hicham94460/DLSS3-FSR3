================================
===== Install instructions =====
================================

1. Locate your game's installation directory with DLSSTweaks (e.g. _nvngx.dll) installed.

2. Copy "dlssg_dlsstweaks_wrapper.dll" and "dlssg_to_fsr3_amd_is_better.dll" to your game's installation directory.

3. Find "dlsstweaks.ini" and open it in Notepad.

4. Find the line "[DLLPathOverrides]" after scrolling down to the middle of the INI file.

5. Find the line ";nvngx_dlssg = C:\Users\Username\...\nvngx_dlssg.dll" underneath.

6. Replace the line with "nvngx_dlssg = C:\Path\To\The\Game\dlssg_dlsstweaks_wrapper.dll".

   You MUST TYPE THE FULL DLL PATH and remove the ";" at the beginning. Dlssg-to-fsr3 may not work otherwise.

7. Done. Launch the game. You'll see a message box on startup.
